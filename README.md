# What is Stripe Advanced Terminal?
 Originaly, it was created by DevinLewis on Envato, but, since he doesn't support anymore this system, we had to find a solution and basically, we developed and updated system with SCA Support for European Cards, with new SRC of Stripe. 
 This is a private development, and it's not an open-source.
